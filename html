            <h2>Job Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>Currently as an owner of my own roofing company there is a lot that I have to deal with. 
                Daily I have to build estimates, schedule builds, keep up with financials, and help out my sales
                employees. It is incredibly time consuming and busy but it has been incredibly rewarding.

            <h2>Hobbies and Special Interests</h2>
            <p>One of my biggest hobbies the last year or so has been golfing. I picked it up in 2024 and fell in 
                love with it. It is incredibly relaxing and easy to do. I love anything that deals with the outdoors, 
                so I always end up going kayaking as well.

        <section class="career">
            <h2>Reasons for Pursuing This Degree</h2>
            <p>I am pursuing this degree in order to get a bachelors. I only have a few classes left, so I figured I would 
                finish the degree. I do now know if I will use the degree in the future due to how well my business has 
                been going, but I have always had an interest in tech.
